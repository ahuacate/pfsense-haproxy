# HAProxy in pfSense as a Reverse Proxy
If you want convenient remote access to your LXC's and/or Apps the easiest way is to setup a remote proxy. What we are going to achieve here using a domain you own is:
*  unifi.myserver.com --> unifi 192.168.1.251
* appname.myserver.com --> appname 192.168.1.XXX
